# Chrome Manifest V2 Policy Manager

## ðŸ“Œ What This Tool Does

Google Chrome is phasing out Manifest V2 extensions and replacing them with Manifest V3, which breaks many older extensions. This tool lets you control a hidden Chrome policy called **ExtensionManifestV2Availability**, which can allow Manifest V2 extensions to keep working â€” just like some apps (e.g., IDM) do.

By changing this policy, Chrome will think itâ€™s managed by an organization and will allow certain blocked extensions.

**âš  Note:** This change is local to your computer and does **not** let anyone (like your office or Google) see your browsing history.

## ðŸ”„ How to Undo the Change

If you no longer need Manifest V2 extensions:

1. Run the script again as Administrator
2. Choose **Option 5** â†’ `Remove policy`
3. Restart Chrome

## âš  Important Notes

* Chrome will show **"Managed by your organization"** in the menu after enabling this â€” this is normal.
* This method may stop working in the future if Google fully removes Manifest V2 support from the browser.
* Some extensions may still not work if Google blocks them for security reasons.
